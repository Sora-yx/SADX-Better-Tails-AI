# SADX Better Tails AI

Better Tails AI is a mod for the PC Version of Sonic Adventure DX. The mod allow Tails AI to spawn pretty much everywhere in the game, including: Hub World, Chao Garden, Bosses, Sand Hill and Twinkle Circuit. He will also spawn with a snowboard if you play Sand Hill or Ice Cap (You know, details...) Miles also plays a synchronised victory animation with the player one. (Details again, mostly because of Sonic 3 & Knuckles.)

Crowning touch: Tails AI also spawns with any character! That's right, Fox box will follow Big in his journey to catch Froggy!

Note: You can change the settings to disable Miles at some specific place.
To avoid crashes and conflicts, Tails AI doesn't spawn in some very unique places during a specific part of a character's story. The goal in the future is to reduce that as much as possible.
